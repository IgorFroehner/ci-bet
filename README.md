A casino of circle CI. It's a slack bot where you can bet on circle CI workflows. When a college push a commit it can 
start a game. People then can bet on the outcome of the CI of the game, if it will fail or succeed.

## Setup

### Prerequisites(Recommended)

A domain(or a subdomain) is ready to host the application

### If you need to set up a new Slack app:

1. Create a new app [here](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1)
2. Navigate to the **OAuth & Permissions** page and add the following **Bot Token Scopes**: 
- `users:read`
- `channels:read`
- `groups:read`
- `chat:write`
- `commands`
- `incoming-webhook`  
  **BASE_URL** stands for https://slackbot-hosted-domain.com hereafter.  
  Use this url for **Redirect** : `BASE_URL`
3. Activate **Interactivity & Shortcuts** and add this url: `BASE_URL/api/slack/action` 
4. Activate **Slash Commands** adding two slash commands `/ping`, `/quiz` and use this url: `BASE_URL/api/slack/command`
5. Activate **Event Subscriptions** subscribing to the event type `member_joined_channel` and add this url: `BASE_URL/api/slack/event`(This step needs the application to be running :D so you can skip this and come back a few mins later)
6. Navigate to the **App Home** page and toggle **Always Show My Bot as Online** (according to your reference)

### Clone the repository and install dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

### Prepare .env file

```
Go to https://api.slack.com/apps and click your application.
